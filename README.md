# What's pyparallel?
The pyparallel is a python-based tool for distributing values of a for-loop iterable.
Using this tool you can easily distribute a block of code in for-loop to multiple processes / machines.

You can immediately try this code by running a demo script `example.sh`.

## matlab version

You can immediately try the code by running a following script.

```
# assume your current directory is the root folder of pyparallel.
cd ../
matlab -r "addpath pyparallel; Script_demo_matprange;exit"
cd -
```
